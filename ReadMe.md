## 📚 Step-by-Step Guide

If the quick link doesn't work, or if you prefer to do it manually within VS Code, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisite
Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

### Steps

1.  **Open VS Code** on your computer.
2.  Copy the profile URL:
    ```
    [https://vscode.dev/profile/github/b3344e03925f15682d05e2ce00751c18](https://vscode.dev/profile/github/b3344e03925f15682d05e2ce00751c18)
    ```
3.  In VS Code, open the **Command Palette** by pressing:
    * `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
    * `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS)
4.  Type **"Profiles: Import Profile..."** and select it.
5.  A box will appear at the top. **Paste the URL** you copied and press **Enter**.
6.  VS Code will show a preview of the profile. Click the blue **Import Profile** button to finish.

Your VS Code will instantly update with the new theme, settings, and will begin downloading the necessary extensions.
